## swift-package

Update the dependencies according to the restrictions inside `Package.swift` and update accordingly the 
file `Package.resolved`.
```
swift package update
```

Resolve the dependencies declared inside `Package.resolved` when the file already exists or by taking into 
account the restrictions inside `Package.swift`. In the last case the file `Package.resolved` will be 
created.
```
swift package resolve
```
