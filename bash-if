# Syntax

```
if <test>; then 
	<commands>
elif <test>; then
	<commands>
else
	<commands>
fi
```

The branch's condition *<test>* can be:

- a *command*, if it succeds (return code is zero) then the *<test>* evaluates to true;
	- `test EXPRESSION`;
	- `[ EXPRESSION ]`;
- a combination of commands separated using control operators:
	- `! test EXPR1 && test EXPR2 || test EXPR3`

# Primary expressions
The square brackets work similar to the test command. Inside square brackets
these expressions can be used.

[ -a FILE ]	True if FILE exists.
[ -b FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a block-special file.
[ -c FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a character-special file.
[ -d FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a directory.
[ -e FILE ]	True if FILE exists.
[ -f FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a regular file.
[ -g FILE ]	True if FILE exists and its SGID bit is set.
[ -h FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a symbolic link.
[ -k FILE ]	True if FILE exists and its sticky bit is set.
[ -p FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a named pipe (FIFO).
[ -r FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is readable.
[ -s FILE ]	True if FILE exists and has a size greater than zero.
[ -t FD ]	True if file descriptor FD is open and refers to a terminal.
[ -u FILE ]	True if FILE exists and its SUID (set user ID) bit is set.
[ -w FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is writable.
[ -x FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is executable.
[ -O FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is owned by the effective user ID.
[ -G FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is owned by the effective group ID.
[ -L FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a symbolic link.
[ -N FILE ]	True if FILE exists and has been modified since it was last read.
[ -S FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a socket.
[ FILE1 -nt FILE2 ]	True if FILE1 has been changed more recently than FILE2, or if FILE1 exists and FILE2 does not.
[ FILE1 -ot FILE2 ]	True if FILE1 is older than FILE2, or is FILE2 exists and FILE1 does not.
[ FILE1 -ef FILE2 ]	True if FILE1 and FILE2 refer to the same device and inode numbers.
[ -o OPTIONNAME ]	True if shell option "OPTIONNAME" is enabled.
[ -z STRING ]	True of the length if "STRING" is zero.
[ -n STRING ] or [ STRING ]	True if the length of "STRING" is non-zero.
[ STRING1 == STRING2 ]	True if the strings are equal. "=" may be used instead of "==" for strict POSIX compliance.
[ STRING1 != STRING2 ]	True if the strings are not equal.
[ STRING1 < STRING2 ]	True if "STRING1" sorts before "STRING2" lexicographically in the current locale.
[ STRING1 > STRING2 ]	True if "STRING1" sorts after "STRING2" lexicographically in the current locale.
[ ARG1 OP ARG2 ]	"OP" is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt or -ge, these are arithmetic binary operators.

# Combination of expressions
[ ! EXPR ]	True if EXPR is false.
[ ( EXPR ) ]	Returns the value of EXPR. This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.
[ EXPR1 -a EXPR2 ]	True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true.
[ EXPR1 -o EXPR2 ]	True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true.

# Examples
if true && false; then echo "true"; fi
if true && [[ 1 > 0 ]] ; then echo "true"; fi
if true && [ 1 -gt 0 ] ; then echo "true"; fi
